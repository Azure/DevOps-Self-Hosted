# DevOps Self-Hosted Constructs Repository

<img src="./docs/wiki/media/homeOverviewImage.png" alt="Overview" height="350">


## Description

This repository provides you with several constructs (i.e. templates & pipelines) to deploy solutions around self-hosted agents for DevOps environments.

In some instances you can combine the constructs to, for example, build an image for self-hosted Managed DevOps Pool agents. Furthermore, constructs may be based on the [Azure Verified Modules](https://aka.ms/avm) library to simplify deployments.

Currently the repository contains the following constructs:

| Construct | Description | Path |
| - | - | - |
| Azure Image Builder | This construct provides a packages solution to create custom images using the Azure Image Builder service with an Azure Compute Gallery, including guidelines to operate it. | [`constructs/azureImageBuilder`](https://github.com/Azure/DevOps-Self-Hosted/tree/main/constructs/azureImageBuilder) |
| Managed DevOps Pool | This construct provides a packaged solution to deploy the infrastructure for self-hosted Managed DevOps Pools, including guidelines to maintain it. | [`constructs/managedDevOpsPool`](https://github.com/Azure/DevOps-Self-Hosted/tree/main/constructs/managedDevOpsPool) |

For detailed information on the constructs and how to get started, please continue to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Azure/DevOps-Self-Hosted/wiki).
